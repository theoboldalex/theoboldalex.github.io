One of the main contributing factors to my journey towards burnout is trying to find a language or platform that I like better than PHP. As a long time minimalist
and having read Thoreau, I should know that "Comparison is the thief of joy", but I frequently get caught in these spirals of trying new languages in the hope of finding
the silver bullet that would allow me to leave the PHP world behind. The trouble is, I find the same or similar pain points and problems in every ecosystem that I have tried
to date. Included in that list are old warriors C# and Java; as well as mulitple scripting languages like Python and Ruby and new cool kids on the block such as NodeJs and Go.
