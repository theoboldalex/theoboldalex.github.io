Deadlines are by their very nature, anti-agile. There is no more sure-fire way to ensure that software projects are delivered poorly
than imposing deadlines on delivery. Before we get into the why, I'm categorically _not_ saying that we shouldn't aim for delivering
within a scope of effort, rather that fixed deadlines (usually imposed by non technical people) are not only a waste of time but are 
actually detrimental to the delivery of robust working software.

## A Finger in the Air

How often do we get it right?

## Cutting Corners

Code standards slip. Keep coding we will fix it later. Less robust. Something has to give (tests, observability)

## Needless Stress

Burnout, working unpaid overtime.

## Conclusion

Takes the fun out of building things.
