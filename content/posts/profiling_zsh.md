Flashback to 2023. I was working with Node on a project and needed to switch between versions easily. A quick Google search led me to [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager)
which promised to allow me to install and use different Node versions via the command line. Perfect. Or so I thought.
