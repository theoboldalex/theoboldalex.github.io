I love this time of year for many reasons (and hate it for many more) but one of my favorite things about this time of year is that taking time away from 
work for the holidays allows me time to reflect on what is going well in my life and what needs to change.

In previous years, I have set goals in several different ways. Last year, I set monthly goals which linked to longer term goals and checked in on my progress regularly.
This worked well in some areas and not so well in others so this year I am aiming to tweak my approach.

** A Word of the Year

My wife used the notion of a word of the year last year and it worked incredibly well for her so this year I am going to give this a shot myself. After much reflection, I have chosen
a word that is important to me. Simplicity.

** Simplicity
