- get link to allen holub quote in dave farley video
- find quote from trisha gee video re: can't write good comments cant write good code

We have surely all heard the trope that [hiring in tech is broken]() at this point, but I recently listened to a discussion on David Farley's [Engineering room podcast]() 
with Allen Holub as the guest which really got the cogs turning for me and helped me to take a step back and reflect on how I got to where I am now. The podcast conversation
took many turns, all of which were interesting and in some cases eye-opening but something that really stuck with me was an avenue that the pair examined and that was around
hiring engineers in tech.
