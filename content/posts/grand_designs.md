I have made [my thoughts on story points]({{< ref "Say No To Story Points">}}) abundantly clear.

This post is about estimation and how it is too often conflated with a deadline.

## FrAgile Egos

My experience with (big A) Agile proponents has been that they are some of the most resistant to change, dogmatic believers, I have ever had the
displeasure of working with. It is ironic really as agility is all about being adaptable and embracing change. These people cannot seem to see
past what was sold to them by ScrumCorpÂ® when they paid all that money for their scrum certificate.

For me, agility is taking what works for my team and leaning into that. If something does not work, we drop it and try something else. By doing
this consistently, we have managed to drop standup, retro, refinement, planning, review and a whole host of other pointless meetings from our calendar
giving us more time to focus on doing meaningful work. As an example, we do not need a meeting every morning to ask whether someone is blocked.
If they are blocked, we start a team call immediately and discuss. Once we have a plan to unblock them, we take action, there and then. No waiting
for next week's meeting.

## Your guess is as good as mine

What many of the Scrum/Agile/SaFE proponents seem to miss and more importantly, what most businesses fail to comprehend is that estimations are 
exactly that; guesses. Some guess are more informed than others but they are still guesses. I recently got into a discussion with another tech lead
who argued that he could accurately estimate how long a project would take based on previous team velocity. He was so confident, he was willing to put a wager on it.
Needless to say, he owes me lunch. The problem with estimating based on previous performance assumes consistent resource, no blockers or unknowns
and knowing exactly when a project will kick off. Example; a project estimated at 3 sprints is more likely to run over its estimate if the work begins
in mid December than if it starts in March. Estimates don't factor in life. Holidays, sickness, production issues and a whole host of other factors 
that can slow delivery. The larger the project, the higher the variance.
