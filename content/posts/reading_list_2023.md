I read a lot. I know that 'a lot' is relative but I have found that in comparison to my colleagues, my two hours average reading a day puts me way above the average.

In 2022, I read 8 tech books and while I learned a lot, on reflection, I sacrificed depth for quantity. For that reason, this year I will be focussing on only four tech
books, two of which will be books I also read last year. the aim of this, is to glean as much value from each of these texts as I possibly can.

So, with that said, which books will I be focussing my attentions on this year? As you will see in the follwing list, a theme appears again and again and that is testing.
I know that this is an area in which I need to get better and have been making efforts in this direction for the past year, evidenced in my open source contributions but 
I still feel I have a lot to learn in this area until TDD becomes second nature as a practice that is integral to my workflow. I don't do this because it is a trend but because
I have seen foirst hand in my own work, the benefits of working in this way.

Let's get into the list;

## Extreme Programming Explained

I'm a huge fan of Kent Beck's work and this book has been on my reading list for quite some time. While I am familiar with the concepts
of XP and have read much about it in the past, there is no substitute for the original.

## Modern Software Engineering

This is the most recently released book in the list but is already being talked about as a future classic. I have been following Dave Farley's
YouTube channel for some time now and always find his content interesting and engaging. I'm not sure what to expect from this one but I am 
really looking forward to dig into it.

## Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns

## Test Driven Development By Example
