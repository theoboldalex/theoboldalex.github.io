I have been a programmer now for nearly a decade. In that time, I have completed countless side projects (and started many more than that)
To this day, I am yet to create anything particulalry useful or interesting. Part of me has felt a bit disappointed about this at times and 
sometimes it feels like I'm "falling behind". But what is the point of a side project? Well, for me it is about learning and exploration.
Not every project must be an open source success with a solid user base and nor should it. The most fun and insightful side projects I have
worked on have had very little practical value and they are often the projects that have the worst coding standards, most buggy code and are
thrown together quickly sometimes in matter of hours.
