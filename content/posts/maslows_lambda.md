Lately, I have been using and contributing to [Bref](https://bref.sh/). It is a fantastic tool and allows me to write serverless functions
in PHP on AWS Lambda. This is a great thing no doubt. Not only can I write lambda functions in a language that feels really comfortable, 
but through Composer, I also have access to all my favorite packages.

This is not just about the benefits of serverless though. At AWS Summit London in early 2022, I attended a lot of talks where serverless 
workloads were pushed hard and a less skeptical mind might be forgiven for thinking that serverless is all upside with no downside. After coming home from that conference I experimented with Serverless framework and some AWS CDK and found them fine but not as earth shattering as I had been led to believe. Yeah, it was great, I didn't have to manage my own servers, it was incredibly easy to deploy and with the level of traffic these apps were expecting, the workloads would be essentially free; forever.
