Lately, I have been using and contributing to [Bref](https://bref.sh/). It is a fantastic tool and allows me to write serverless functions
in PHP on AWS Lambda. This is a great thing no doubt. Not only can I write lambda functions in a language that feels really comfortable, 
but through Composer, I also have access to all my favorite packages.
