Ok, last week's Project Euler solution using nothing but Vim was so fun to do, I decided to up the ante this week and attempt
to solve the second problem in the Euler archive (Even Fibonacci Numbers). 
This one is much more tricky; so get your [Macros](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros) ready and let's dive in.

The problem states...


> **Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with and, the first terms will be:**

> **1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...**

> **By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.**

## Getting started with the sequence

Much like last time, we need to start by generating a sequence of numbers. This time though, the the sequence isn't simply incrementing intergers
but is a more complex sequence. Unfortunately there isn't a command built in to Vim that will help us here so we will have to do it ourselves.

To create the sequence we will record a macro, but first we need a single, simple equation to work from. If you are familiar with the fibonacci sequence, it is often exaplained as starting from zero and one summed, followed by the result of that summed with one and then on and on continually summing the previous two numbers in the sequence.

Leet's start then by opening vim and entering insert mode on the first line of our fresh buffer. On this line, we will enter the text `1+1`. As simple an equation as we will ever see.
