Ok, last week's Project Euler solution using nothing but Vim was so fun to do, I decided to up the ante this week and attempt
to solve the second problem in the Euler archive (Even Fibonacci Numbers). 
This one is much more tricky; so get your [Macros](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros) ready and let's dive in.

The problem states...


> **Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with and, the first terms will be:**

> **1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...**

> **By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.**
