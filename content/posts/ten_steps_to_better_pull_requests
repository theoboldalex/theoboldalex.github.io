1. Keep it concise
 - Short
 - focussed on one change
2. Check yourself
 - Review your PR before sharing with others
 - look out for rogue var_dumps/console.logs
 - Are comments explaining the why, not the what?
 - Does your code have tests?
3. Explain yourself
 - Provide a write up, documentation links or evidence that your change does what you think it does
4. Atomic commits
 - Pauline Vos Git Legit talk
5. Share the love
 - Get involved in reviewing other people's PRs, they are likely to return the favour
 - Fastest way to learn a system in by reviewing small, focussed changes that are explained
