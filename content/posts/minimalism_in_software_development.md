So a few days ago I read and contributed to [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/zzlce3/minimalism_as_a_guiding_principle_in_software/) and it got me to thinking.
As a person that would begrudgingly identify as a 'Minimalist' whatever, that term actually means nowadays, I think that the desire to strip things back to only the essential in my life, aligns
really well with software development and the practices, habits and principles I bring to my work.
