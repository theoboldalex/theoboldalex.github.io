I don't use vim because it makes me more productive (maybe it does) but because it makes me happy.

Self help books have a lot to answer for. Hustle culture, focus on productivity at all costs. Nobody seems to be talking about developer happiness or doing the _right_ thing, only that we do what we do in the most efficient way possible.

Hopping on the high speed train to London is useless if your goal is to get to Glasgow (assuming you live between those two places of course).

Lots of measures of productivity. Commits, PRs, Jira issues closed. Very few if any measures of happiness.

Burndown charts are the same. They tell only a small part of a story. They say absolutely nothing about the quality or value of work, just that people are busying away at... _something_.
