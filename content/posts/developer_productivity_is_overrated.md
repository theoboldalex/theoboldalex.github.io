Productivity. It is not just a buzzword; it is the driving force behind a deluge of NYT bestsellers. Echoed relentlessly by every blogger,
YouTuber and entrepreneurial grifter that can force their way into our gaze for what seems like the past decade. Even the workplace has not escaped
the trend with bosses eyeing increased productivity to bring them their bonuses year after year and squeeze ever more from their "Human resources".

The focus on productivity at all costs, especially when looking at developers is flawed. I believe that with a focus on joy, we not only create
 more content teams but we also lead to high performing, productive teams.

There are many measures of developer productivity, all of which are flawed; however, this doesn't seem to stop the Scrum crowd trying to measure the
success of teams with a small number of imperfect metrics. Let's take a look at some of these.

### Velocity
Ah, yes! Velocity, the siren song of Scrum masters the world over. The focus on moving ever faster misses the point entirely. Imagine thinking that 
you could measure success by the speed of travel. Moving at 100mph towards London is useless if the goal is to get to Glasgow. Instead, focus on 
providing challenging, meaningful work that has a business impact and productivity will take care of itself.

### Commits
Commits, PRs, deployment frequency, resolved Jira issues. All of these can be measured yet they tell us absolutely nothing of the impact that work 
is having. That is not to say that those things are without merit entirely but they are not measures we should be using to tell us about
how good or not a team is. For a reasonable look at how some of these metrics can be used as indicators of team health, see the [DORA metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html)

Again, the focus should be on doing the _right_ work rather than doing busy work. Optimise for impact.

### Take away

I totally believe that trying to measure and improve productivity is the wrong thing to do. By focussing instead on building happy, impactful teams
that feel challenged and appreciated will in itself lead to increased productivity as a side effect.

I liken this to the reason I use Vim as my editor of choice (here he goes again with the Vim). I don't use Vim because it gives me some kind of 
productivity gain, in fact, some things may actually be less efficient in Vim than in some modern IDEs. I use it instead because it makes me happy
and has a deep and interesting history with a never ending learning curve. Because of that, it keeps me interested and wanting to improve how I use it.
That alone is enough to increase _my_ productivity.
