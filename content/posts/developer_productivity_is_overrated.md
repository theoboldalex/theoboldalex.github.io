I don't use vim because it makes me more productive (maybe it does) but because it makes me happy.

Self help books have a lot to answer for. Hustle culture, focus on productivity at all costs. Nobody seems to be talking about developer happiness or doing the _right_ thing, only that we do what we do in the most efficient way possible.

Hopping on the high speed train to London is useless if your goal is to get to Glasgow (assuming you live between those two places of course).

Lots of measures of productivity. Commits, PRs, Jira issues closed. Very few if any measures of happiness.

Burndown charts are the same. They tell only a small part of a story. They say absolutely nothing about the quality or value of work, just that people are busying away at... _something_.

=============

Productivity. It is not just a buzzword; it is the driving force behind a deluge of NYT bestsellers. Echoed relentlessly by every blogger,
YouTuber and entrepreneurial grifter that can force their way into our gaze for what seems like the past decade. Even the workplace has not escaped
the trend with bosses eyeing increased productivity to bring them their bonuses year after year and squeeze ever more from their "Human resources".

The focus on productivity at all costs, especially when looking at developers is flawed. I believe that with a focus on joy, we not only create
 more content teams but we also lead to high performing, productive teams.

There are many measures of developer productivity, all of which are flawed; however, this doesn't seem to stop the Scrum crowd trying to measure the
success of teams with a small number of imperfect metrics. Let's take a look at some of these.

### Velocity
Ah, yes! Velocity, the siren song of Scrum masters the world over. The focus on moving ever faster misses the point entirely. Imagine thinking that 
you could measure success by the speed of travel. Moving at 100mph towards London is useless if the goal is to get to New York. Instead, focus on 
providing challenging, meaningful work that has a business impact and productivity will take care of itself.
