## Why did I pick up Emacs in the first place?

If Vim is so great, why would I even consider picking up Emacs? In short, I had been learning Clojure and had seen a great community and tooling around Emacs in the Clojure world.
Also, seeing the like of Tsoding using Emacs on stream, I was curious whether I was missing something. So at the start of 2024, 
I pronounced 2024 to be [the year of the Emacs desktop](https://x.com/theoboldalex/status/1743936628022722615), installed it, and got to work builing my lightsaber.

The plan was not to make it my daily driver but to see if I could get a nice, smooth setup with LSP, auto-complete and some customisation in place where I felt that the experience could 
challenge if not match the ergonomics of my NeoVim environment.
