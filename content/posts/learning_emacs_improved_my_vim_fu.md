## Why did I pick up Emacs in the first place?

If Vim is so great, why would I even consider picking up Emacs? In short, I had been learning Clojure and had seen a great community and tooling around Emacs in the Clojure world.
Also, seeing the like of Tsoding using Emacs on stream, I was curious whether I was missing something. So at the start of 2024, 
I pronounced 2024 to be [the year of the Emacs desktop](https://x.com/theoboldalex/status/1743936628022722615), installed it, and got to work builing my lightsaber.

The plan was not to make it my daily driver but to see if I could get a nice, smooth setup with LSP, auto-complete and some customisation in place where I felt that the experience could 
challenge if not match the ergonomics of my NeoVim environment.

## What did I like about Emacs?

## What did I not like about Emacs?

## Efficiency of movement

## Avoiding Evil mode

As a long time user of Vim that gets annoyed at the implementations of Vim bindings in other editors (looking at you VSCode and JetBrains) I decided to steer clear of Evil mode.
Perhaps my on ramp may have been smoother if I had opted to use it but honestly, a little study and practice of the "Holy" bindings and within a week or so, I was starting to move 
with relative ease. I especially spent some time learning and practicing some of the editing tasks I take for granted in Vim for example using macros and various visual modes. I must say that Emacs' rectangle mode is a joy to use for editing.
## Macros
## Searching forwards and backwards
## Splits
## Dired
