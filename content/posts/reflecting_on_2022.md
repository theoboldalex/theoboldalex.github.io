As we enter another new year, I like to reflect on the past 12 months in relation to my goals to see my successes, my failures and how I can improve
my process of both goal setting and habits going into the new year. At the start of 2022 I set myself a number of developer related goals specifically tied 
to the work I do day to day and I think this paid off.
