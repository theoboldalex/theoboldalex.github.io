Another rainy British weekend, another wholly unnecessary project. This time, I thought it would be fun to find out whether I could solve
some simple problems starting from an empty Vim buffer and running some commands to get to the correct answer. It was actually easier than I
anticipated although I did cheat a little by resorting to an AWK command to do some of the work. The alternative was to write a vimscript function
which felt wrong when I can call some throwaway awk script right from the Vim command prompt.
