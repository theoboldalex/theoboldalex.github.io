I have been a MacOS user for over 20 years. I have long held the belief that the Macbook is the finest portable machine available to consumers and that the tight integration
between quality hardware and software is worth the premium you pay for such a machine, but recently that changed.

I got my first Macbook in 2004. I had saved up for months to obtain the white plastic clamshell 13" laptop. At the time, It was the epitome of cool. Pretty much everyone else was running Windows XP and though
I have fond memories of Windows in that era, once I got a taste for MacOS, I never even considered a move back to Windows. Mostly because at that time, my main use case was recording the music
of my band. I had tried, unsuccessfully to do some recording with a Tapco interface and a cheap microphone into an old Windows laptop but the Mac, with Garageband and later Logic Pro was
sublime in comparison.

Over the next 15 years, I owned several more machines after that original Macbook literally fell to pieces (it lasted 7 years of heavy usage). Everything from hand-me-down Macbook Pros, to 27" iMacs
and a couple of Mac Minis and even a second hand G4 PowerPC Mac Pro. I bought my most recent Macbook in 2019. A 2018 model 13" Macbook Air with 8GB of RAM. At the time, a pretty solid machine for the simple websites
and Ruby on Rails web apps I was creating as a hobbyist developer.

To say I had become comfortable in MacOS would be an understatement. I had configured my operating system over the years to be minimal (or as minimal as Apple will allow) and consistently disabled
most features that many Mac users love and was heavily keyboard driven in my workflow. I have continued to happily use MacOS into my career as a professional developer without any major issues but recently things 
have started to change. While I still enjoy MacOS for work and love the build quality of Macbooks, I can no longer justify the cost of replacing my personal machine every few years with a high spec Apple device
when there are cheaper, more powerful alternatives available. This is even more obvious now that my personal computer gets less use than it used to given I spend most of my time on my work machine. Apples moves toward soldered components has
also helped push me away as one of the main factors in me being able to make my devices last a long time over the years was the ability to replace batteries, hard drives and RAM.

So with that, the search for a replacement began. I had heard great things about think pads although new, they cost almost as much as a Macbook so that went out of the equation. I looked at refurbished machines from a couple of generations back
and also considered a Framework laptop after DHH made a similar move that I was planning. I ended up deciding on a MinisForum UMD790 Pro thanks in no small part to this video from [No Boilerplate's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq9O99TgFv4).
I went for the 32GB RAM version which set me back just short of Â£600 delivered next day.

Setup was easy and I swiftly wiped Windows and installed the latest Ubuntu version (after having to dick around with Microsoft Bitlocker to allow me to remove Windows) and I was away.
