I have been a MacOS user for over 20 years. I have long held the belief that the Macbook is the finest portable machine available to consumers and that the tight integration
between quality hardware and software is worth the premium you pay for such a machine, but recently that changed.

I bought my last Macbook in 2019. A 2018 model 13" Macbook Air with 8GB of RAM. At the time, a pretty solid machine for the simple websites and Ruby on Rails web apps I was creating as a 
hobbyist developer.
