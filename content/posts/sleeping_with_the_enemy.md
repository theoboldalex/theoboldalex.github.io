I have been a MacOS user for over 20 years. I have long held the belief that the Macbook is the finest portable machine available to consumers and that the tight integration
between quality hardware and software is worth the premium you pay for such a machine, but recently that changed.

My first Macbook was back in 2004. One of the white plastic clamshell 13" laptops. At the time, It was the epitome of cool. Pretty much everyone else was running Windows XP at the time and though
I have fond memories of Windows back then, once I got a taste for MacOS, I never even considered a move back to Windows. Mostly because at that time, my main use case was recording the music
of my band. I had tried unsuccessfully to do some recording with a Tapco interface and a cheap microphone into an old Windows laptop but the Mac, with Garageband and later Logic Pro was
sublime in comparison.

Over the next 15 years, I owned several more machines after that original Macbook literally fell to pieces after 7 years of heavy usage. Everything from hand-me-down Macbook Pros, to 27" iMacs
and a couple of Mac Minis and a G4 PowerPC Mac Pro. I bought my most recent Macbook in 2019. A 2018 model 13" Macbook Air with 8GB of RAM. At the time, a pretty solid machine for the simple websites
and Ruby on Rails web apps I was creating as a hobbyist developer.

To say I had become comfortable in MacOS would be an understatement. I had configured my operating system over the years to be minimal (or as minimal as Apple will allow) and consistently disabled
most features that many Mac users love and was heavily keyboard driven in my workflow. I have continued to happily use MacOS into my career as a professional developer without any major issues but recently things 
have started to change. While I still enjoy MacOS for work and love the build quality of Macbooks, I can no longer justify the cost of replacing my personal machine every few years with a well specced Apple device
when there are cheaper, more powerful alternatives available. This is even more obvious now that my personal computer gets less use than it used to given I spend most of my time on my work machine.
