This may sound crazy coming from someone that has used Neovim for a long time, has just fully rewrote their config from scratch and is in the process of writing a book about Emacs.

- coding is no longer my primary role
- I don't need much in terms of functionality
- Basically zero config
- Not even using vim motions plugins
- Still using emacs and neovim outside of work for "fun" code
- I was a big fan of sublime text. Looking for an editor like that but with modern plugin ecosystem for LSP etc
