I love running. It hasn't always been this way. Back when I was sixteen and had just joined the British Army, I saw running as a necessary evil, a means to an end but 
over the past two decades my passion for running has developed through repetition and mastering the fundamentals. Most importantly I have learned that for me, the biggest beenfit
of running is not in its physical stimuli but in the way that it develops mental discipline and robustness. This has never been more clearly illustrated to me than in the
last quarter of 2022 when I suffered what is known in the running community as a `calf heart attack`. This injury stopped me from doing any running at all for nine weeks.
The detrimental effect on my physical robustness was clear (also not helped by easy access to lots of Christmas food) but the bigger challenge for me was that it 
had a significant impact on my mental clarity especially around my work and could have easily lead to burnout if it wasn't for some careful self-reflaction and help
from my colleagues who thankfully noticed some red flags before I did.

My injury struck in a busy time for my team. I had taken on some extra responsibilities, we had some new team members that I was helping to ramp up, I had just returned 
from Defcon in the United States and recovered from a nasty bout of Covid and as someone with a rather obsessive personality, I tend to immerse myself in my work, sometimes
in a less than healthy way. I usually combat this with running as it gets me away from my computer, allowing me to do some cognitve housekeeping. By this I mean that
I can allow myself to think without distraction and let my mind wander or tackle problems in a more abstract way. Without the outlet provided by my daily run, I found that 
I was simply working longer and longer hours and trying to do more and more work but without the mental clarity gained from running, I was actually delivering less value 
than before.
