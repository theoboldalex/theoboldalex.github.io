I love running. I have loved running for as long as I can remember. It is the one of the most humbling, rewarding and enjoyable things in my life.
That is why when at the tail end of October this year I picked up a nasty calf injury, I was disappointed. Not least because I was 
building upmy running in preparation for a half marathon in February 2023 but also because I see running as my super power but not for the
reasons that you would think. To me the ultimate benefit of running is in the way it allows me to do some cognitive housekeeping. By this
I mean that the flow state that I can find only through running provides an opportunty for me to look at probelms in a different light.
This is especially important to for a personality like mine that immerses myself in my work to the point of obsession (also, 
to the detriment of other aspects of life in rare cases).

## The injury

Running has a habit of humbling you just when you think you know best. I was six weeks into a half-marathon training block and everything was going great.
I was dropping a little weight and I was handling the increased weekly mileage just fine. Then I started to get a slight niggle in my left calf. I ran through this 
for a couple more easy days but it started to get progressivley worse. I decided a rest day or two should be ample recovery time to get over this and 
back into my training so took afew days off to recover but had a big hill rep session planned for Saturday and really didn't want to miss it.

When Saturday came, I still had a little soreness but decided to do the session anyway. I thought thst if I could just do a good solid warm up of a few miles staedy state running then I would
be able to complete the session. How wrong I was. The warm up miles were fine and were actually soe of the most enjoyable running I did during this training block but once the main hill session
started, the pain started to intensify. Finally at the top of the eigth hill rep of ten, I felt a sharp pain in my calf and knew I was done. I was about a mile and a half from home and in a
deep wooded valley. Unable to walk properly, it was a long, slow, embarrassing slog back up the mountain to get home.

This has taught me a valuable lesson though, and that is that I must learn to listen to myself and keep an eye out for warning signs. This applies not only to my running but also
to my work.

## The Burnout backstory

Just back from Defcon, got bad case of covid

## What is cognitive housekeeping?

## Learnings from this

I need an outlet outside of my work otherwise I can hyper focus on it to the detriment of myself and others and have sailed too close to 
burnout this time.
