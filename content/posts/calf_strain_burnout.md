I love running. I have loved running for as long as I can remember. It is the one of the most humbling, rewarding and enjoyable things in my life.
That is why when at the tail end of October this year I picked up a nasty calf injury, I was disappointed. Not least because I was 
building upmy running in preparation for a half marathon in February 2023 but also because I see running as my super power but not for the
reasons that you would think. To me the ultimate benefit of running is in the way it allows me to do some cognitive housekeeping. By this
I mean that the flow state that I can find only through running provides an opportunty for me to look at probelms in a different light.
This is especially important to for a personality like mine that immerses myself in my work to the point of obsession (also, 
to the detriment of other aspects of life in rare cases).

## The injury

Running has a habit of humbling you just when you think you know best.

## The Burnout backstory

Just back from Defcon, got bad case of covid

## What is cognitive housekeeping?

## Learnings from this

I need an outlet outside of my work otherwise I can hyper focus on it to the detriment of myself and others and have sailed too close to 
burnout this time.
