## A debate as old as time
Like spaces vs tabs and Emacs vs Vim, the debate between zealots on either side of the debate around debuggers has dragged on for so long 
that most people are probably bored of it now but us developers love to argue about unimportant things (see: Bike Shedding).

So why drag this subject back up if we are all so bored of it? 

Well it turns out the "to debug or not to debug" debate comes up so often in work that I think there is some value in sharing my stance on the 
subject (if for the sole reason that I can just point people here next time I get dragged into this debate).
