Welcome to the Scrum universe, where there are just two unwavering certainties: developers will come to despise it, and if they dare to 
voice their complaints, they will be swiftly dismissed as "doing it wrong".

Scrum has committed untold crimes against programming; the most heinous of which is the
[flagrant and unapologetic affront to the very essence of software development]({{< ref "more_project_euler_in_vim">}}); story points.

## It's Official

The public blog of the _official_ Scrum guide has [this](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/why-do-we-use-story-points-estimating) to say about story points:

> Story Points are intended to make team estimating easier. Instead of looking at a product backlog item and estimating it in hours, teams consider only how much effort a product backlog item will require, relative to other product backlog items.

My first point of contention with the above is that any non-trivial programming task cannot be estimated to any level of accuracy in hours, days, even weeks in some cases so the comparison is pointless.

Secondly, the notion that we can or _should_ estimate units of work relative to each other leads to what I have come to call "Bikeshedding Unbounded".

## WTF is a five-pointer anyway?

## Taoist Tale

Let us pause and reflect on a story that may or may not be based on real events.

> One day during their lunch break, the young apprentice, Fu, approached his master, Bah, his face displaying a perplexed expression. Sensing Fu's inner turmoil, Master Bah invited him to share his concerns.

> With reverence, young Fu took a seat across from his wise master and inquired, "Master, I am curious. Why, when a sprint can effortlessly accommodate twenty story points, do we estimate two sprints for a project that is sized at only ten story points?"

> Master Bah responded with a knowing smile, selecting a small cracker from his plate. He gently broke it in half, placing the first portion into his mouth, savoring the taste as he chewed thoughtfully.

> In silence, he then adorned the second half with a pinch of salt before consuming it, all the while maintaining his serene smile. "Much improved," Master Bah remarked.

> In that singular moment, enlightenment washed over the young apprentice.

## Stifled creativity

Estimation discourages course correction. The Scrum literature claims that one of the framework's core benefits is that it allows you to `inspect
and adapt`. My experience is in direct contravention to this though. Estimating just leads to developers running with the first idea of a solution that
they have, never stopping to think whether the solution is _actually good_. This is not helped of course by non-technical stakeholders taking
estimates as deadlines and pushing development teams for ever more work in smaller timeframes.

Due to the inaccurate nature of estimations by definition, developers rush through units of work to keep client deadlines on course; 
inevitably producing projects which over time become unmaintainable, big balls of mud.

I am yet to see any non-trivial example contrary to this.
