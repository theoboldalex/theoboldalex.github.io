Welcome to the Scrum universe, where there are just two unwavering certainties: developers will come to despise it, and if they dare to 
voice their complaints, they will be swiftly dismissed as "doing it wrong".

Scrum has committed untold crimes against programming; the most heinous of which is the
[flagrant and unapologetic affront to the very essence of software development]({{< ref "more_project_euler_in_vim">}}); story points.

## It's Official

The public blog of the _official_ Scrum guide has [this](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/why-do-we-use-story-points-estimating) to say about story points:

> Story Points are intended to make team estimating easier. Instead of looking at a product backlog item and estimating it in hours, teams consider only how much effort a product backlog item will require, relative to other product backlog items.

My first point of contention with the above is that any non-trivial programming task cannot be estimated to any level of accuracy in hours, days, even weeks in some cases so the comparison is pointless.

Secondly, the notion that we can or _should_ estimate units of work relative to each other leads to what I have come to call "Bikeshedding Unbounded".

## WTF is a five-pointer anyway?

## Estimation a.k.a Mental Gymnastics

## Stifled creativity

## Anti-Agile
