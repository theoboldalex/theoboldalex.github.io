Last year I wrote a post about how I was going to focus on only reading a small number of important books and while this was not perfect, and I did reading some books that were not on the original list (and didn't read one of those that was), I found it to be
a good way to keep me focussed throughout the year and I learned a ton from the four books that I selected so this year I plan to do the same with a different set of books.

## Effective C

## The Art of Functional Programming

## The Little Schemer

## Crafting Interpreters
